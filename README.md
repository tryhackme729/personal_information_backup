# personal_information_backup
Backing up all my personal information online (it is my real information!!) for idiot hackers to crack.
P.S: I want to save your time, so please start brute forcing, starting from 20 characters.
Dictionary attacks will not work, I mixed in computer generated gibberish (that I memorized) into my passwords.
It is NOT a passphrase, it is literally a pseudogibberish password that I practiced typing in hundreds of times.

Example: smooth_@}kkn_bagel_<G!xL_thirstie
